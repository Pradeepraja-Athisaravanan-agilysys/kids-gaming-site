# Kids Gaming Site

This project is a functional, visually appealing, and interactive website for kids, driven by JSON data for branding, theming, and content.

## How it Works

The site is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and dynamically populated using data from the `/data` directory:

- **`branding.json`**: Contains all branding information, such as the logo, slogan, contact details, and social media links.
- **`theme.json`**: Defines the visual theme of the site, including the color palette and fonts.
- **`games.json`**: Holds the content for the site, including the list of games, the site tagline, and the countdown timer target.

## Learning Checkpoints

This project is designed with learning in mind. Look for the `<!-- TODO: student exercise -->` and `// TODO: student exercise` comments in the code to find opportunities to extend the project's functionality.

### Customization

- **Branding**: Edit `data/branding.json` to change the logo, slogan, and contact information.
- **Theming**: Modify `data/theme.json` to update the site's colors and fonts.
- **Content**: Add or remove games by editing `data/games.json`.

Changes to these files will be reflected on the site immediately upon reloading the page.
